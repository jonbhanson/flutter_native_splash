When your app is opened, there is a brief time while the native app loads Flutter.  By default, during this time, the native app displays a white splash screen.  This package automatically generates iOS, Android, and Web-native code for customizing this native splash screen background color and splash image.  Supports dark mode, full screen, and platform-specific options.

# What's New

You can now keep the splash screen up while your app initializes!  No need for a secondary splash screen anymore.  Just use the `preserve` and `remove` methods together to remove the splash screen after your initialization is complete.  See [details below](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_splash#3-set-up-app-initialization-optional).


Method `removeAfter` has been deprecated, `remove` method should be used insead.

# Usage

Would you prefer a video tutorial instead?  Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB0dOnc2k10">Johannes Milke's tutorial</a>.

First, add `flutter_native_splash` as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_native_splash: ^2.1.3+1
```

Don't forget to `flutter pub get`.

## 1. Setting the splash screen
Customize the following settings and add to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file or place in a new file in your root project folder named `flutter_native_splash.yaml`.

```yaml
flutter_native_splash:

  # This package generates native code to customize Flutter's default white native splash screen
  # with background color and splash image.
  # Customize the parameters below, and run the following command in the terminal:
  # flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
  # To restore Flutter's default white splash screen, run the following command in the terminal:
  # flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:remove

  # color or background_image is the only required parameter.  Use color to set the background
  # of your splash screen to a solid color.  Use background_image to set the background of your
  # splash screen to a png image.  This is useful for gradients. The image will be stretch to the
  # size of the app. Only one parameter can be used, color and background_image cannot both be set.
  color: "#42a5f5"
  #background_image: "assets/background.png"

  # Optional parameters are listed below.  To enable a parameter, uncomment the line by removing
  # the leading # character.

  # The image parameter allows you to specify an image used in the splash screen.  It must be a
  # png file and should be sized for 4x pixel density.
  #image: assets/splash.png

  # The branding property allows you to specify an image used as branding in the splash screen.
  # It must be a png file. Currently, it is only supported for Android < v12 and iOS.
  #branding: assets/dart.png

  # To position the branding image at the bottom of the screen you can use bottom, bottomRight,
  # and bottomLeft. The default values is bottom if not specified or specified something else.
  #branding_mode: bottom

  # The color_dark, background_image_dark, image_dark, branding_dark are parameters that set the background
  # and image when the device is in dark mode. If they are not specified, the app will use the
  # parameters from above. If the image_dark parameter is specified, color_dark or
  # background_image_dark must be specified.  color_dark and background_image_dark cannot both be
  # set.
  #color_dark: "#042a49"
  #background_image_dark: "assets/dark-background.png"
  #image_dark: assets/splash-invert.png
  #branding_dark: assets/dart_dark.png

  # Android 12 handles the splash screen differently than previous versions.  Please visit
  # https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/splash-screen
  # Following are Android 12 specific parameter.
  android_12:
    # The image parameter sets the splash screen icon image.  If this parameter is not specified,
    # the app's launcher icon will be used instead.
    # Please note that the splash screen will be clipped to a circle on the center of the screen.
    # App icon with an icon background: This should be 960×960 pixels, and fit within a circle
    # 640 pixels in diameter.
    # App icon without an icon background: This should be 1152×1152 pixels, and fit within a circle
    # 768 pixels in diameter.
    #image: assets/android12splash.png

    # App icon background color.
    #icon_background_color: "#111111"

    # The image_dark parameter and icon_background_color_dark set the image and icon background
    # color when the device is in dark mode. If they are not specified, the app will use the
    # parameters from above.
    #image_dark: assets/android12splash-invert.png
    #icon_background_color_dark: "#eeeeee"

  # The android, ios and web parameters can be used to disable generating a splash screen on a given
  # platform.
  #android: false
  #ios: false
  #web: false

  # The position of the splash image can be set with android_gravity, ios_content_mode, and
  # web_image_mode parameters.  All default to center.
  #
  # android_gravity can be one of the following Android Gravity (see
  # https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Gravity): bottom, center,
  # center_horizontal, center_vertical, clip_horizontal, clip_vertical, end, fill, fill_horizontal,
  # fill_vertical, left, right, start, or top.
  #android_gravity: center
  #
  # ios_content_mode can be one of the following iOS UIView.ContentMode (see
  # https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/contentmode): scaleToFill,
  # scaleAspectFit, scaleAspectFill, center, top, bottom, left, right, topLeft, topRight,
  # bottomLeft, or bottomRight.
  #ios_content_mode: center
  #
  # web_image_mode can be one of the following modes: center, contain, stretch, and cover.
  #web_image_mode: center

  # To hide the notification bar, use the fullscreen parameter.  Has no effect in web since web
  # has no notification bar.  Defaults to false.
  # NOTE: Unlike Android, iOS will not automatically show the notification bar when the app loads.
  #       To show the notification bar, add the following code to your Flutter app:
  #       WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  #       SystemChrome.setEnabledSystemUIOverlays([SystemUiOverlay.bottom, SystemUiOverlay.top]);
  #fullscreen: true
  
  # If you have changed the name(s) of your info.plist file(s), you can specify the filename(s) 
  # with the info_plist_files parameter.  Remove only the # characters in the three lines below,
  # do not remove any spaces:
  #info_plist_files:
  #  - 'ios/Runner/Info-Debug.plist'
  #  - 'ios/Runner/Info-Release.plist'
```

## 2. Run the package
After adding your settings, run the following command in the terminal:

```
flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
```

When the package finishes running, your splash screen is ready.

To specify the YAML file location just add --path with the command in the terminal:

```
flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create --path=path/to/my/file.yaml
```

## 3. Set up app initialization (optional)

By default, the splash screen will be removed when Flutter has drawn the first frame.  If you would like the splash screen to remain while your app initializes, you can use the `preserve()` and `remove()` methods together.  Pass the `preserve()` method the value returned from `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` to keep the splash on screen.  Later, when your app has initialized, make a call to `remove()` to remove the splash screen.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_native_splash/flutter_native_splash.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsBinding widgetsBinding = WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  FlutterNativeSplash.preserve(widgetsBinding: widgetsBinding);
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

// whenever your initialization is completed, remove the splash screen:
    FlutterNativeSplash.remove();

```


NOTE: In order to use this method, the `flutter_native_splash` dependency must be in the `dependencies` section of `pubspec.yaml`, not in the `dev_dependencies` as was the case in previous versions of this package.

## 4. Support the package (optional)
If you find this package useful, you can support it for free by giving it a thumbs up at the top of this page.  Here's another option to support the package:

# Android 12 Support

Android 12 has a [new method](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/features/splash-screen) of adding splash screens, which consists of a window background, icon, and the icon background.  Note that a background image is not supported.

The package provides Android 12 support while maintaining the legacy splash screen for previous versions of Android.

***PLEASE NOTE:*** The splash screen may not appear when you launch the app from Android Studio.  However, it should appear when you launch by clicking on the launch icon in Android.
  
# FAQs
## I got the error "A splash screen was provided to Flutter, but this is deprecated."

This message is not related to this package but is related to a [change](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/advanced/splash-screen#migrating-from-manifest--activity-defined-custom-splash-screens) in how Flutter handles splash screens in Flutter 2.5.  It is caused by having the following code in your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`, which was included by default in previous versions of Flutter:

```xml
<meta-data
 android:name="io.flutter.embedding.android.SplashScreenDrawable"
 android:resource="@drawable/launch_background"
 />
```
The solution is to remove the above code.  Note that this will also remove the fade effect between the native splash screen and your app.

## Are animations/lottie/GIF images supported?
Not at this time.  PRs are always welcome!

## I got the error AAPT: error: style attribute 'android:attr/windowSplashScreenBackground' not found
This attribute is only found in Android 12, so if you are getting this error, it means your project is not fully set up for Android 12.  Did you [update your app's build configuration](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/setup-sdk#config)?

## I see a flash of the wrong splash screen on iOS
This is caused by an [iOS splash caching bug](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33002829/ios-keeping-old-launch-screen-and-app-icon-after-update), which can be solved by uninstalling your app, powering off your device, power back on, and then try reinstalling.

## I see a white screen between splash screen and app
1. It may be caused by an [iOS splash caching bug](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33002829/ios-keeping-old-launch-screen-and-app-icon-after-update), which can be solved by uninstalling your app, powering off your device, power back on, and then try reinstalling.
2. It may be caused by the delay due to initialization in your app.  To solve this, put any initialization code in the `removeAfter` method.

## Can I base light/dark mode on app settings?
No. This package creates a splash screen that is displayed before Flutter is loaded. Because of this, when the splash screen loads, internal app settings are not available to the splash screen. Unfortunately, this means that it is impossible to control light/dark settings of the splash from app settings.

# Notes
* If the splash screen was not updated correctly on iOS or if you experience a white screen before the splash screen, run `flutter clean` and recompile your app. If that does not solve the problem, delete your app, power down the device, power up the device, install and launch the app as per [this StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33002829/ios-keeping-old-launch-screen-and-app-icon-after-update).

* This package modifies `launch_background.xml` and `styles.xml` files on Android, `LaunchScreen.storyboard` and `Info.plist` on iOS, and `index.html` on Web. If you have modified these files manually, this plugin may not work properly. Please [open an issue](https://github.com//jonbhanson/flutter_native_splash/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) if you find any bugs.

# How it works
## Android
* Your splash image will be resized to `mdpi`, `hdpi`, `xhdpi`, `xxhdpi` and `xxxhdpi` drawables.
* An `<item>` tag containing a `<bitmap>` for your splash image drawable will be added in `launch_background.xml`
* Background color will be added in `colors.xml` and referenced in `launch_background.xml`.
* Code for full screen mode toggle will be added in `styles.xml`.
* Dark mode variants are placed in `drawable-night`, `values-night`, etc. resource folders.

## iOS
* Your splash image will be resized to `@3x` and `@2x` images.
* Color and image properties will be inserted in `LaunchScreen.storyboard`.
* The background color is implemented by using a single-pixel png file and stretching it to fit the screen.
* Code for hidden status bar toggle will be added in `Info.plist`.

## Web
* A `web/splash` folder will be created for splash screen images and CSS files.
* Your splash image will be resized to `1x`, `2x`, `3x`, and `4x` sizes and placed in `web/splash/img`.
* The splash style sheet will be added to the app's `web/index.html`, as well as the HTML for the splash pictures.
